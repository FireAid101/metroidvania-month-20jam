So the idea for this metroidvania would be a fantasy based one!

What about a reverse metroidvania when instead of going down, you are coming back up.

So after pressing start in the menu, a cutscene plays where you are thrown into a pit and you fall down, all the way into the bottom and you get trapped into the dungeon

So the theme will be a dungeon, so I'll need some dungeon assets. 

I would like to add other areas into the game but I am pretty limited. So I'll stick to a overall dungeon theme with some caverns sprinkled in

So we will have dungeon which will be what is mostly there and 

Some items:
	-> Sword -> can damage enemies, can cut rope
	-> Armour -> can help you sink, protect you, can use as weight for pressure plates
	-> Torch -> can lightup dark areas, can burn wood, can shoot arows through to make lit arrows
	-> Bow -> long range weapon, can be uses for puzzles can be used to zipline down ropes
	-> Ropes -> Can be used to reach higher places, Can ties things together
	-> Bombs -> Can blow things up, can send things rocketing, can use to to destroy enemies, can be used to solve puzzles

	The game has to be 3 hours long so, I better get to it

tips for creating a metroidvania:

	1. Let the game teach the mechanics without saying anything. Let the players discover
	2. Tease the player with areas that they cannot access yet
	3. Have multiple possibilities for the mechanics for more discovery possibitlies.

	world rules:

	1. Draft the map
	2. Develop the timeline (the keys, items, bossess etc to progress the game)
